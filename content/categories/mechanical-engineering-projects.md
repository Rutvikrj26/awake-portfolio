  **Mechanical engineering** is
  an [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering
  "Engineering") branch that combines [engineering
  physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics "Engineering
  physics") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_mathematics
  "Engineering mathematics") principles with [materials
  science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "Materials
  science") to [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design "Design"), analyze,
  manufacture, and maintain [mechanical
  systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_system "Mechanical
  system").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering#cite_note-1) It
  is one of the oldest and broadest of the [engineering
  branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_engineering_branches "List of
  engineering branches").


  The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), [dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_dynamics "Analytical dynamics"), [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics"), [materials science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "Materials science"), [structural analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_analysis "Structural analysis"), and [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity "Electricity"). In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as [computer-aided design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design "Computer-aided design") (CAD), [computer-aided manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_manufacturing "Computer-aided manufacturing") (CAM), and [product lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle "Product lifecycle") management to design and analyze [manufacturing plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_plants "Manufacturing plants"), [industrial equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_equipment "Industrial equipment") and [machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_machinery "Industrial machinery"), [heating and cooling systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC "HVAC"), [transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport "Transport") systems, [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft"), [watercraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercraft "Watercraft"), [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics"), [medical devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_devices "Medical devices"), [weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons "Weapons"), and others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of [machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine "Machine").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering#cite_note-2)


  Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world. In the 19th century, developments in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") led to the development of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as [composites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material "Composite material"), [mechatronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics "Mechatronics"), and [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology"). It also overlaps with [aerospace engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering "Aerospace engineering"), [metallurgical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_engineering "Metallurgical engineering"), [civil engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering "Civil engineering"), [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), [manufacturing engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_engineering "Manufacturing engineering"), [chemical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering "Chemical engineering"), [industrial engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering "Industrial engineering"), and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts. Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of [biomedical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering "Biomedical engineering"), specifically with [biomechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics "Biomechanics"), [transport phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_phenomena "Transport phenomena"), [biomechatronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechatronics "Biomechatronics"), [bionanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionanotechnology "Bionanotechnology"), and modelling of biological systems.
