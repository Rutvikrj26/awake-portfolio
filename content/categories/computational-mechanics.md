  **Computational mechanics** is the discipline concerned with the use of
  computational methods to study phenomena governed by the principles
  of [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics
  "Mechanics").[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_mechanics#cite_note-GhaboussiWu2016-1) Before
  the emergence of [computational
  science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science "Computational
  science") (also called scientific computing) as a "third way" besides
  theoretical and experimental sciences, computational mechanics was widely
  considered to be a sub-discipline of [applied
  mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mechanics "Applied
  mechanics"). It is now considered to be a sub-discipline within computational
  science.


  The projects in the field of computational mechanics follow a list of tasks to analyze their target mechanical process:


  1. A [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") of the physical phenomenon is made. This usually involves expressing the natural or engineering system in terms of [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"). This step uses [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") to formalize a complex system.

  2. The mathematical equations are converted into forms which are suitable for digital computation. This step is called [discretization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization "Discretization") because it involves creating an approximate discrete model from the original continuous model. In particular, it typically translates a partial differential equation (or a system thereof) into a system of [algebraic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_equations "Algebraic equations"). The processes involved in this step are studied in the field of [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis "Numerical analysis").

  3. [Computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") are made to solve the discretized equations using direct methods (which are single step methods resulting in the solution) or [iterative methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method "Iterative method") (which start with a trial solution and arrive at the actual solution by successive refinement). Depending on the nature of the problem, [supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer") or [parallel computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing "Parallel computing") may be used at this stage.

  4. The mathematical model, numerical procedures, and the computer codes are verified using either experimental results or simplified models for which exact [analytical solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression "Closed-form expression") are available. Quite frequently, new numerical or computational techniques are verified by comparing their result with those of existing well-established numerical methods. In many cases, benchmark problems are also available. The numerical results also have to be visualized and often physical interpretations will be given to the result
