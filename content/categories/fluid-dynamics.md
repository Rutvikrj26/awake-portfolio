  In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics
  "Physics") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering
  "Engineering"), **fluid dynamics** is a subdiscipline of [fluid
  mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics "Fluid
  mechanics") that describes the flow
  of [fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid
  "Fluid")—[liquids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid
  "Liquid") and [gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas "Gas"). It has several
  subdisciplines,
  including [aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics
  "Aerodynamics") (the study of air and other gases in motion)
  and **hydrodynamics** (the study of liquids in motion). Fluid dynamics has a
  wide range of applications, including
  calculating [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force
  "Force") and [moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(physics) "Moment
  (physics)") on [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft"),
  determining the [mass flow rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_flow_rate
  "Mass flow rate") of [petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum
  "Petroleum") through [pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport
  "Pipeline transport"), [predicting weather
  patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting "Weather
  forecasting"), understanding [nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula
  "Nebula") in [interstellar
  space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_space "Interstellar
  space"), and [modeling fission weapon
  detonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_design "Nuclear
  weapon design").


  Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these [practical disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_disciplines "Practical disciplines")—that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from [flow measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_measurement "Flow measurement") and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as [flow velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_velocity "Flow velocity"), [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure "Pressure"), [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density"), and [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature"), as functions of space and time.
