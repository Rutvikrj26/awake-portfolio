# To defeat your enemy, you must first know him, his weaknesses and his strength.

### A personal recommendation: Go through the [official book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14x2f7xACwpkdoGQ01D0s76rUcfrGMaQZ/view?usp=sharing) thoroughly, you'll get a lot of examples on the exam.

# Quantitative Reasoning Section

This Section measures your understanding of basic Mathematical skills, elementary Mathematical concepts and ability to reason quantitatively and to model and solve problems with quantitative methods.

The questions are "word problems," which must be translated and modeled mathematically. The skills, concepts and abilities are assessed in the four content areas below.

* **Arithmetic** topics include properties and types of integers, such as divisibility, factorization, prime numbers, remainders and odd and even integers; arithmetic operations, exponents and roots; and concepts such as estimation, percent, ratio, rate, absolute value, the number line, decimal representation and sequences of numbers.
* **Algebra** topics include operations with exponents; factoring and simplifying algebraic expressions; relations, functions, equations and inequalities; solving linear and quadratic equations and inequalities; solving simultaneous equations and inequalities; setting up equations to solve word problems; and coordinate geometry, including graphs of functions, equations and inequalities, intercepts and slopes of lines.
* **Geometry** topics include parallel and perpendicular lines, circles, triangles — including isosceles, equilateral and 30°-60°-90° triangles — quadrilaterals, other polygons, congruent and similar figures, three-dimensional figures, area, perimeter, volume, the Pythagorean theorem and angle measurement in degrees. The ability to construct proofs is not tested.
* **Data analysis** topics include basic descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, interquartile range, quartiles and percentiles; interpretation of data in tables and graphs, such as line graphs, bar graphs, circle graphs, boxplots, scatterplots and frequency distributions; elementary probability, such as probabilities of compound events and independent events; conditional probability; random variables and probability distributions, including normal distributions; and counting methods, such as combinations, permutations and Venn diagrams. These topics are typically taught in high school algebra courses or introductory statistics courses. Inferential statistics is not tested.

The content in these areas includes high school mathematics and statistics at a level that is generally no higher than a second course in algebra; it does not include trigonometry, calculus or other higher-level mathematics.

The Quantitative Reasoning measure has four types of questions. Click on the links below to get a closer look at each, including sample questions with explanations.

* [Quantitative Comparison Questions](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/quantitative_reasoning/comparison)
* [Multiple-choice Questions — Select One Answer Choice](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/quantitative_reasoning/multiple_choice_one)
* [Multiple-choice Questions — Select One or More Answer Choices](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/quantitative_reasoning/multiple_choice_more)
* [Numeric Entry Questions](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/quantitative_reasoning/numeric_entry)

Each question appears either independently as a discrete question or as part of a set of questions called a [Data Interpretation set](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/quantitative_reasoning/data_interpretation/). All of the questions in a Data Interpretation set are based on the same data presented in tables, graphs or other displays of data.

You can find steps for solving quantitative problems, including useful strategies for answering questions on the Quantitative Reasoning measure, in [Problem-solving Steps](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/quantitative_reasoning/problem_solving). In addition, the pages for each of the four Quantitative Reasoning question types and the Data Interpretation set page, mentioned above, contain strategies specific to answering those types of questions.

You are allowed to use a basic calculator on the Quantitative Reasoning measure. For the computer-delivered test, the calculator is provided on-screen.

[Official Tips](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/tips/) Provided by ETS, go through them once.

1. Get a **Quick Revision** from the **[Core Concept Reviews](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nCtfVavB_1Bqi31OQS3jBGAEYsAFB5T4?usp=sharing)**
2. **[Practice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EGr7ybhTctz2LGi9r4D5O7U8S-AhMu8j/view?usp=sharing)** a lot, as speed is an important factor in making or breaking your score.
