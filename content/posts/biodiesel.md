Bio diesel is a renewable alternate source of petroleum and can be used in engine. It is
Eco-friendly, nontoxic and it is thought to be future diesel. Petroleum is natural source that is rapidly depleted. Bio fuel is obtained from vegetable oil, algae, edible and non-edible beans. It is derived from triglycerides and fatty acids by trans-esterification and esterification, respectively. As we all know that fossil fuels are limited resources, we heavily depend on petroleum for transportation, industries, and agricultural machinery. Industrialization, urbanization and increasing population is increasing demand of energy. To satisfy our increasing energy requirements consumption of fossil fuel which are limited. In cities, air contamination increases because diesel engine is a big pollution source by traffic in urban areas. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are rapidly increases and many other gasses from smoke are releases. so pressure on researchers to search alternate way of diesel to reduce environmental pollution. In diesel engine emissions, using mineral diesel, the presence of sulphur results in sulphur oxides and sulfates\[13]2. When these sulfur chemicals are released into the atmosphere they form sulfur dioxide which combines with water to form sulfuric acid. This acid is carried by winds to neighboring regions, dropping onto the land when it rains. This phenomenon is known as acid rain.

The finite nature of fossil fuels necessitates consideration of alternative fuels from renewable sources. Bio-Diesel is an alternative to liquid fossil fuels prevalent in society.

This is an excellent sustainable resource of Energy and can be produced from oils. Here
using non-edible oils and producing Bio-diesel actually puts us in a cycle where we produce
CO2 by burning Bio-Diesel and at the same time, we need to grow trees for producing
oils(edible/non-edible).Bio-diesel is free from sulphur (as it is derived from vegetable oils)
and its use substantially reduces the emissions of SO2 and aromatics as well. Even
on blending with mineral diesel, bio-diesel significantly reduces emissions.
Currently, there are various options for sustainable energy sources but developing them
would require a setup of totally new technology and infrastructure which would cost high
and at the same time would not be of any help to Developing Nations. They still have
areas which aren’t even electrified, so bringing new technology in rural areas is practically
impossible. But what if we did not have to change the whole of the infrastructure and just by changing the source of energy, we could make the power cheaper and sustainable along with it being Eco-friendly. That would be a win-win situation and very beneficial.
Most of our current diesel engines can be used with very minor change in engines.It has better quality exhaust gas emission since the organic carbon present in it is photosynthetic in origin. It does not contribute to increase the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and consequently to the greenhouse effect. In spite of higher emission level of NOx, the emission from bio-diesel combustion contained lower amounts of CO, CO2, HC
and smoke.

### Current Requirements

Currently there are several ways to determine amount of reactants for maximum output but
as the main purpose of Bio-Diesel to make rural areas self sustainable in terms of energy
has failed because the net rate that a person needs to pay for knowing required amounts for one oil combination is very high as it includes the use of high-end technologies such as
spectroscopy which are not available to a common man.


Currently, the world works on thumb rule and assumptions about the amount of catalyst
and methanol to be used. The values used are not optimized and hence not cost-effective
and neither Energy effective. Let’s say for increasing yield by 1 percent it might be taking
1 more hour of heat, which results in loss of more heat energy than gain in bio diesel. This
could be stopped if we have a model that could predict outputs within a tolerance zone.
People have tried to make models but are either not publicly available or not publicly
useful as the conditions used by them are primarily different and hence the kinetics of the
oil gets varied. Even the catalysts used by them were different which changes the amount
by which the energies of activation of forward and backward reactions are altered which
can lead to totally different values required for the optimized reaction. Furthermore the
models made are just by experimental analysis of one oil and no generalized model has yet
been made according to current research while we want to make a correlation between various factors of input and the yield we get of the bio-diesel.

### Design Package Development

An important reason why major biodiesel projects tend to fail is because they are major. The oil tends to degenerate, reducing it's effectiveness for biodiesel conversion over time. The time for storage and transportation are major factors in degradation of oil, making it unsuitable for the project. Thus, if we want to make biodiesel an effective system, the biodiesel setup must be decentralized. The oil needs to be produced locally and converted to biodiesel at the place itself. 

For this purpose we have done a project on creating a design package for Mini-Biodiesel reactor that can cater to the needs of  several households. **This will not only impact the environment positively but also boost local enterpreneurship,** where local enterpreneurs can be supplied with one set and they produce and sell the fuel locally. Further, since the operating cost of the machine and the price of the raw materials is low, it can have a much cheaper price.
