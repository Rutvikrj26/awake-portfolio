# To defeat your enemy, you must first know him, his weaknesses and his strength.

### A personal recommendation: Go through the [official book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14x2f7xACwpkdoGQ01D0s76rUcfrGMaQZ/view?usp=sharing) thoroughly, you'll get a lot of examples on the exam.

The Verbal Reasoning assesses your **ability to analyze and evaluate written material and synthesize information obtained from it, analyze relationships among component parts of sentences and recognize relationships among words and concepts.**

Verbal Reasoning questions appear in several formats, each of which is discussed in detail in the corresponding sections linked to below. About half of the measure requires you to read passages and answer questions on those passages. The other half requires you to read, interpret and complete existing sentences, groups of sentences or paragraphs.

The Verbal Reasoning measure contains three types of questions. Click on the links below to get a closer look at each,Â including sample questions with explanations.

* [Reading Comprehension](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/verbal_reasoning/reading_comprehension)
* [Text Completion](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/verbal_reasoning/text_completion)
* [Sentence Equivalence](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/verbal_reasoning/sentence_equivalence)

Problems you might face and solutions to some of them.

1. **Vocabulary**: Vocabulary is one of the weakest points of non-native english speakers and aspirants need to focus as much as they can and not more than that. The Vocabulary is important but what's more important is the sense of meaning they create in different scenarios. Only mugging up the vocabulary is one of the biggest mistakes people do and should not be repeated as the exam makers are well versed with these rott learning techniques and trust me, they don't appreciate it. instead if you have to learn English and are willing to improve your vocabulary, why not just do it in such a way that it not only benefits in your exam, but also has a lasting impact on your life. 

   Words are the way through our mind thinks of concepts. Without words, you won't be able to think of a anything and thus the building blocks of language are essentially also the building blocks of your thinking ability and broadness. The impact of Vocabulary on the success of a person(may it be academic or professional or personal) has been well documented through psychological experiments.

   I would recommend going through the Book "**[Word Power Made Easy](https://www.amazon.in/Word-Power-Made-Norman-Lewis/dp/8183071007)**". The book is very cheap and one of the best to lay a sound foundation that will help you grasp on further knowledge easily. 
2. **Time:** Time is one of the other issues that a non-native speaker faces in the verbal section. Attempting 20 questions in 30 minutes becomes a problematic task for slow readers and there is no other option than to increase your reading speed. The skimming technique that some people use for better time-management also relies on the ability to read fast and see through the paragraphs. The strategies do help to reduce the time taken by comprehensions, but at the end, speed does matter. 

   Hopefully, the solution is evidently easy. The only improvement one needs for increasing reading speed is to gain momentum in reading, which can be easily increased by practice. Go through the book mentioned in the "Vocabulary" section. That will help you develop better speed also.

For prepping effectively and at the best speed, 

1. **[Completely read the book](https://www.amazon.in/Word-Power-Made-Norman-Lewis/dp/8183071007)** in an engaging manner. Work as mentioned in the book.

   #### **All the Best for the Exam.**

   #### **Quick Checks for hassle free exam experience -** 

   1. Make sure the **First/Given Name and the Last name** on the Passport and the ETS website account details match **EXACTLY.** If they don't, **mail the the support team** and get it corrected atleast  10-15 days before exam. 
   2. Apart from passport, also take some kind of chocolate or something of the sorts  that could charge you up with energy, as the exam is long and the 10 min break can be helpful to have something, re-energize and refresh yourself.
