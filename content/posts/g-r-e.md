# To defeat your enemy, you must first know him, his weaknesses and his strength.

### A personal recommendation: Go through the [official book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14x2f7xACwpkdoGQ01D0s76rUcfrGMaQZ/view?usp=sharing) thoroughly, you'll get a lot of examples on the exam. 

# Analytical Writing

This section guages your abilities of critical thinking and writing. There are three important things that one should keep in mind while attempting this section:

1. **Read the Question and respond to it.** This questions' primary aim is to check your understanding of the question and how well you are able to comprehend the ideas presented in it.
2. **Critical Thinking.** The Question does require, to some extent the ability to critically reason and put down points either in favor or against the argument presented.
3. **Presentation.** This is the last important skill that needs to be developed in order to awe the reader. The ideas need to be well-connected and flow smoothly throughout your essay. The essay shouldn't be a hotchpotch, which has several great ideas, but the ideas are not well presented and hence, an opportunity wasted.

### Task 1: Analyze an Issue

The "Analyze an Issue" task assesses **your ability to think critically about a topic** of general interest and to **clearly express your thoughts about it in writing.** 

* Each Issue topic makes a claim that can be discussed from various perspectives and applied to many different situations or conditions. 
* Your task is to present a compelling case for your own position on the issue. 

  #### Advice:
* Before beginning your written response, be sure to **read the issue** and the instructions that follow the Issue statement. 
* **Think about the issue from several points of view**, considering the complexity of ideas associated with those views. 
* **Make notes about the position you want to develop and list the main reasons and examples you could use to support that position.**

### Task 2: Analyze an Argument

This is where you need to be extra careful. The task is to analyze someone else's argument. Read the argument, apply your critical thinking skills, and analyze the argument, **Don't make a new of your own.**

The task generally **assesses your ability to understand, analyze and evaluate arguments** according to specific instructions and **to convey your evaluation clearly in your writing.** Each topic consists of a brief passage in which the author makes a case for some course of action or interpretation of events by presenting claims backed by reasons and evidence.

Your **task is to discuss the logical soundness of the author's case by critically examining the line of reasoning and the use of evidence.** You might want to read the argument more than once and make brief notes about points you want to develop more fully in your response. In reading the argument, you should pay special attention to:

* **what is offered as evidence**, support or proof
* **what is explicitly stated**, claimed or concluded
* **what is assumed** or supposed, perhaps **without justification** or proof
* **what is not stated**, but **is indirectly assumed or stated**

In addition, you should consider the *structure* of the argument — the way in which these elements are linked together to form a *line of reasoning*; i.e., you should recognize the separate, sometimes implicit steps in the thinking process and consider whether the movement from each step to the next is logically sound. In tracing this line, look for transition words and phrases that suggest the author is attempting to make a logical connection (e.g., *however, thus, therefore, evidently, hence, in conclusion*).

#### Avoid the Pitfall & Perform well by following some simple Guidelines

An important part of performing well on the Argument task is **remembering what you are *not* being asked to do**:

* You are **not being asked to discuss whether the statements in the argument are true or accurate.**
* You are **not being asked to agree or disagree with the position stated**.
* You are **not being asked to express your own views on the subject being discussed** (as you were in the Issue task).

Instead, **you are being asked to evaluate the logical soundness of an argument of another writer and, in doing so, to demonstrate the critical thinking, perceptive reading and analytical writing skills** that university faculty consider important for success in graduate school.
